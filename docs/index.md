# Welcome to CPTL Docs

**Create unique time-lapses of your servers spanning months at a time!** CPTL is an add-on tool for CoreProtect that will automatically step through your CoreProtect logs to help create a time-lapse from historical data of any length.

Besides using its API, this tool is not affiliated with CoreProtect.

This tool is best used with [ReplayMod](https://modrinth.com/mod/replaymod/) or [Flashback](https://modrinth.com/mod/flashback/) and *requires* [CoreProtect](https://modrinth.com/plugin/coreprotect) to be installed through the entire desired time-lapse period.

# Requirements

- Minecraft `1.21` through `1.21.10`
- Java `21`
- CoreProtect `23.1+` (API v11+)

# Example Time-Lapses
